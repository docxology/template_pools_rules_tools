# Scripts — template_pools_rules_tools

Thin orchestrators: validate sources, run integration, generate manuscript
variables, validate strong-rule compliance, and generate figures. Business
logic lives in `src/`.

## Files

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `01_validate_sources.py` | Validate fonds, rule sets, and tool manifests. |
| `02_run_integration.py` | Run the end-to-end integration demo and write its report. |
| `03_generate_manuscript.py` | Write integration-derived manuscript variables. |
| `04_validate_strong_rules.py` | Evaluate strong rules against the project context. |
| `05_generate_figures.py` | Generate the nine PNG assets and the eight-label registry. |
| `z_generate_manuscript_variables.py` | Hydrate tokens into the render tree. |

`05_generate_figures.py` runs the real integration-derived figure set, mirrors
it to `output/figures/`, and writes `figure_registry.json` only after the eight
referenced figures declared in `src/figures.py` are present. Cover art remains
an unreferenced extra and is not misrepresented as manuscript evidence.
